A project I did from Angela Yu's 100 day Python Developer course. <br />
Im curious to if I did this project correctly.  It felt easier than it should have. <br />
Was this project suppose to be done differently to better utilize dictionary knowledge? <br />
Instead of using dictionary syntax, I just referenced the values and added them to the main code, felt like cheating <br />

Added the function request_coins() <br />
I think I'm struggling with the concept of scope.  I'm getting a [NameError: name 'quarters' is not defined]
