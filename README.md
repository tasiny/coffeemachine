# coffeemachine
A project I did from Angela Yu's 100 day Python Developer course.
Im curious to if I did this project correctly.  It felt easier than it should have.
Was this project suppose to be done differently to better utilize dictionary knowledge?
Instead of using dictionary syntax, I just referenced the values and added them to the main code, felt like cheating
